# Juego-ahorcado-Retro
I have made this retro style hangman game with the idea of giving a more attractive visual image to the game. 
Adding sounds when you hit or miss one of the letters, as well as music to warn you that there is only 1 try 
left and music to wait until you want to play a new game. In addition, the name of the player appears on the 
screen in one of the clouds, as well as the result of the game in another cloud.
